# seismic-fracture-modeling

A software to model seismic reflection data from fractured medium
____

With it you can model the expected seismic reflection data in a fractured medium for the P and S waves in different azimuths.
<p>
  
The files have in their names the types of conversions:<p>
- **fracturePP.py** : calculates the P wave reflection from an incident P wave.
- **fractureP_S.py** : calculates the S wave reflection from an incident P wave.
- **fractureSH.py** : calculates the SH wave reflection from an incident SH wave.
- **fractureSV.py** : calculates the SV wave reflection from an incident SV wave.

### INSTALL

These files assume that you have ANRAY software installed on your computer.<br>
<a>You can find instructions here: http://w3d.cz/software/sw3dcd21/anray/anray.htm <p>
To run the files just copy them to the anray folder and execute with python. **The _gui files must be in the same folder and are resposible to generate the graphical user interface.
